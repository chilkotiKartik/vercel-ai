## 📜 About The Project

In a world where mental health is more important than ever, access to immediate, private, and non-judgmental support can be a challenge. **Vercel** was created to bridge that gap. It's not a replacement for professional therapy, but an **emotional first-aid kit** designed to provide early detection, personalized support, and a safe space for users to understand and manage their feelings.

Our mission is to leverage technology to create an empathetic and accessible tool that empowers users to take the first step on their wellness journey. This project was developed for the [Name of Hackathon] with the goal of making mental health support universally available.

### ✨ Key Features

Vercel is packed with a diverse set of features, each designed with a specific therapeutic purpose in mind:

*   🗣️ **Multi-Lingual AI Analysis:** Users can express their feelings in English, Spanish, Hindi, or Urdu. The AI analyzes the text to provide insights on emotion and risk level.
*   🎭 **Personalized AI Personas:** Get advice from a "Father," "Mother," "Best Friend," or even a "Therapist." The AI's response style changes based on your selection for a more comforting experience.
*   🧸 **My Comfort Box:** A personal, digital safe space featuring powerful interactive tools:
    *   **🗑️ The Thought-Shredder:** Based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), this tool allows users to type out a negative thought and visually "shred" it, providing a tangible sense of control and release.
    *   **🎙️ Voice Affirmation Recorder:** Users can record kind and encouraging messages to their future selves. Hearing one's own calm voice is a powerful grounding technique during moments of distress.
    *   **✨ Item Curation:** Save quotes, notes, music links, or image URLs that bring you peace and comfort.
*   💖 **Anonymous Community Stories:** A feed where users can read and share short, positive stories about overcoming struggles. Vote on stories that resonate with you, creating a supportive and hopeful community.
*   📝 **Mental Health & Well-being Quiz:** A GAD-7 and PHQ-9 inspired questionnaire that provides a wellness score and actionable recommendations based on the user's responses.
*   🎵 **Calming Music Player:** A curated selection of ambient and calming music tracks to help users relax, focus, or meditate.
*   🎮 **Comfort Games:** Simple, non-goal-oriented games designed for stress relief and mindfulness:
    *   **🧘 Zen Garden:** Mindfully rake digital sand.
    *   **💧 Bubble Pop:** The simple, satisfying act of popping bubble wrap.
*   🎁 **Kindness Cache:** A surprise pop-up that appears once per session to deliver a random, positive compliment to the user.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project was built from the ground up using core web technologies, with a focus on a client-side, no-backend implementation suitable for a hackathon.

*   **Front-End:** `HTML5`, `CSS3` (utilizing Flexbox & Grid for layout), `JavaScript (ES6+)`
*   **APIs:**
    *   **Google Gemini API:** For all generative AI-powered analysis and responses.
    *   **Web Speech API:** For voice-to-text input.
    *   **MediaRecorder API:** For recording and saving voice affirmations.
*   **Storage:** `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` are used to persist user data (tasks, comfort box items, etc.) directly in the browser, ensuring privacy.

### 🚀 Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps. This project requires an API key from Google to power its AI features.

#### Installation & Setup

1.  **Get a Free Google AI API Key:**
    *   Navigate to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
    *   Sign in and click **"Get API key"** > **"Create API key in new project"**.
    *   Copy the generated key. You'll need it in a moment.

2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
   clone 
    ```
3.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd Vercel
    ```
4.  **Set Up Your API Key:**
    *   In the project folder, you will find a file named `config.example.js`.
    *   **Rename** this file to `config.js`.
    *   Open the new `config.js` file and **paste your API key** into the placeholder string.

    ```javascript
    // Before (in config.example.js)
    const API_KEY = "PASTE_YOUR_GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY_HERE";

    // After (in your new config.js)
    const API_KEY = "AIzaSy...your...actual...key...";
    ```
    > The `config.js` file is listed in `.gitignore` to ensure your secret key is never committed to GitHub.

5.  **Run the application:**
    *   **The Easy Way (Recommended):** If you use Visual Studio Code, install the **[Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)** extension. Right-click on `HTML.html` and select "Open with Live Server".
    *   **The Simple Way:** You can also just open the `HTML.html` file directly in your web browser.
    
    > **Note:** Using a live server is recommended because some browser features, especially the `MediaRecorder` API, may have security restrictions that prevent them from working when a file is opened directly from the local filesystem (`file:///...`).

### ☁️ Deployment on Vercel

You can easily deploy this project to Vercel. To make the AI work on the live site, you need to set the API key as a secure environment variable.

1.  Push your project to GitHub (ensure `config.js` is in your `.gitignore`).
2.  Import the project into Vercel from your GitHub repository.
3.  In the Vercel project dashboard, go to **Settings -> Environment Variables**.
4.  Add a new variable:
    *   **Name:** `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
    *   **Value:** Paste your actual API key here.
5.  Go to **Settings -> Build & Development Settings**.
6.  Find the **Build Command** field, toggle it ON, and enter the following command:
    ```bash
    echo "const API_KEY = '$GOOGLE_API_KEY';" > config.js
    ```
7.  **Redeploy** your project. The build command will create the `config.js` file on Vercel's server before your site goes live, allowing the AI to function correctly.
